\newcommand\Discriptions{Winds will shift into a southwesterly direction during the late morning and afternoon Saturday. With a weak morning inversion expected, PM2.5 concentrations will rise to allow for a daily average in the moderate range. Sunshine will fade behind clouds late in the afternoon. *** Sundayâs forecast: Sunday will turn out windy and chilly with a couple of rain and snow showers as low pressure passes off to our north. A brisk northwest wind will result in lower PM2.5 concentrations. *** Mondayâs forecast: More clouds than sunshine Monday with a warm front possibly bringing a shower or two late in the day. Light southwest winds will allow for PM2.5 increases and likely moderate air quality. }
