\newcommand\Discriptions{Mostly cloudy with less wind, but not as mild Saturday with showers as a cold front moves through. Winds will shift into the west and northwest late in the afternoon behind the front. A good deal of clouds will keep ozone levels low, with PM2.5 also remaining in the good range. *** Sundayâs forecast: Air quality will be good Easter Sunday with a northwesterly flow of cool, dry air along with sunshine and a few clouds. *** Mondayâs forecast: Low pressure tracking to the southeast Monday will bring a chilly rain back in Monday into Monday night. Southeasterly surface winds will create enough dispersion to where PM2.5 and ozone remain in the good range. }
